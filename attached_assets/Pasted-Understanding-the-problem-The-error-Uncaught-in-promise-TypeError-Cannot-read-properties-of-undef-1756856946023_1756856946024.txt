Understanding the problem
The error Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim') indicates that you are trying to access the trim() method on a variable that is currently undefined. This usually happens when you expect a variable to hold a string value but it doesn't, often because it hasn't been initialized or assigned correctly.

Looking at the stack trace, the error originates in the FinancialTracker.login method within the app.js file, specifically on line 50, column 43. The error is occurring within a Promise, which is why you see "Uncaught (in promise)".

Suggested fix
The most likely cause is that a variable you are attempting to call .trim() on is undefined. You need to identify which variable at app.js:50:43 is causing this issue.

Examine the code around app.js:50:43 in your FinancialTracker.login method. Identify the variable that is being trimmed. Before calling .trim() on this variable, add a check to ensure it is not undefined or null.

For example, if the problematic code looks like this:

js

// app.js line 50
const cleanedInput = someVariable.trim();
Use code snippets with caution

You can modify it to:

js

// app.js line 50
let cleanedInput = '';
if (someVariable !== undefined && someVariable !== null) {
  cleanedInput = someVariable.trim();
} else {
  // Handle the case where someVariable is undefined or null.
  // This might involve showing an error message to the user
  // or assigning a default value to cleanedInput.
  console.error("someVariable is undefined or null. Cannot trim.");
}
Use code snippets with caution

Alternatively, you could use optional chaining and the nullish coalescing operator for a more concise check if the variable is expected to be a string or possibly null/undefined:

js

// app.js line 50
const cleanedInput = someVariable?.trim() ?? '';
Use code snippets with caution

This code will safely call trim() only if someVariable is not null or undefined. If someVariable is null or undefined, someVariable?.trim() will evaluate to undefined, and the nullish coalescing operator (??) will assign an empty string '' to cleanedInput.

You should also investigate why the variable is undefined in the first place. This might point to an issue with how data is being passed to the login method or how form inputs are being accessed.

Summary
The error TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim') occurs when trim() is called on an undefined value. To fix this, identify the variable being trimmed at app.js:50:43 and add checks to ensure it is not undefined before attempting to call trim(). Investigate why the variable is undefined to address the root cause.
